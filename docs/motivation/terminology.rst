Motivation: Terminology
=======================

Before we start, we need to define some common terminology. While the web
itself is rather old, the processes and ways to build web applications are
still rather in its infancy. While web browsers support some UI controls, they
are build for a page or document centric presentation model - not as an
application platform.

A web application presents itself to the user via URL's mapped to HTML pages.
These HTML pages will share a common visual theme and general structure.

The visual theme consists of typography, common icons and images and CSS rules.
