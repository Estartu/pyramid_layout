Pyramid Layout: Composable, Attractive UX for Pyramid
=====================================================

Making an attractive, efficient user-experience (UX) is hard. Pyramid Layout
provides a layout-based approach to building your global look-and-feel
then re-using it across your site. You can then manage your global UX
"layout" as a unit, just like models, views, static resources, and
other parts of Pyramid.

Benefits
========

- Work on your global look-and-feel (aka theme, aka skin,
  aka main template, aka o-wrap) as a distinct artifact.

- Allow per-view, or per-project customization points using familiar
  Pyramid idioms

.. note::

    Pyramid Layout is aimed at ZPT-based applications. You can write panels
    in any templating system, as they simply have to return strings. It
    is possible that you can do all of Pyramid Layout in another
    Pyramid-supported templating system, but that is untested.
