Pyramid Layout: Composable UX for Pyramid
=========================================

Making an attractive, efficient user-experience (UX) is hard. Pyramid Layout
provides a layout-based approach to building your global look-and-feel
then re-using it across your site. You can then manage your global UX
"layout" as a unit, just like models, views, static resources, and
other parts of Pyramid.

Benefits
========

- Work on your global look-and-feel (aka theme, aka skin,
  aka main template, aka o-wrap) as a distinct artifact.

- Allow per-view, or per-project customization points using familiar
  Pyramid idioms.

- Use of any of the common Pyramid templating engines (Chameleon ZPT, Mako, 
  Jinja2) is tested and supported with examples.
