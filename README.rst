Pyramid Layout
==============

Pyramid Layout is an add-on for the Pyramid Web Framework which allows 
developers to utilize the concept of a UI layout to your Pyramid application.
Different layouts may be registered for use in different contexts of your 
application.  The concept of panels is also introduced to facilitate rendering
of subsections of a page in a consistent way across different views in a 
reusable way.

More information is available in the ``docs`` directory.
